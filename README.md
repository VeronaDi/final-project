# final-project
Final project for IT Academy. 
On this project worked 3 students. We divided it between us and everyone was doing his part. But in case someone has trouble,
we tried to find solution together.
My part is: navbar, a bit of footer (social media icons, phone - in mob.version it's callable, email is clickable), page "Order",
datetimepicker (jquery plugin), "add pizza" button and js function, modal window for buttons "Order pizza" and "Book a table".
